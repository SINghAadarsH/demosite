    <h2> Restaurant Listings / Advertising</h2>
    <p>In its first avatar, Are you HUNGRY was just a listing platform and a restaurant directory. This brought in
        advertising
        revenues from restaurants who joined the platform. Extending this further after the launch of food delivery and
        restaurant reservations, AreYouHungry now charges commissions from restaurants to be placed prominently on the
        feed.
        Restaurants can pay to have their events or offers promoted as well as their overall banner, which brings
        improved visibility and conversions from areyouhungry users.

    </p>
    <h2>Food Delivery</h2>

    To begin with, through its food delivery business, <b>areyouhungry</b> charges a commission to the restaurants on the basis of
    orders. While users pay a delivery fee, <b>areyouhungry</b> earns through restaurants who pay a commission for each delivery,
    which is then split among the delivery partner and the company. Commissions from restaurants vary based on whether
    <b>areyouhungry</b> is fulfilling the delivery or whether the restaurant uses its own riders. This is said to contribute in a
    small way to the company’s total income due to huge competition and need for deep discounts etc.

    <h2>Subscription Programmes
    </h2>
    <p>With <b>areyouhungry</b> Gold for consumers and users, and subscription solutions for restaurants, <b>areyouhungry</b> opened up a steady
        stream of revenue. While users pay a subscription fee to access the <b>areyouhungry</b> Gold loyalty programme which brings
        exclusive offers, restaurants also pay a monthly fee to be part of <b>areyouhungry</b>’s bouquet of offers. Restaurants also
        pay <b>areyouhungry</b> a monthly fee for miscellaneous services such as live tracking, <b>areyouhungry</b>-branded tamper-proof packaging
        and more.</p>


    <h2>Live Events</h2>
    <p>With Zomaland, <b>areyouhungry</b> entered the branded live events market last year. <b>areyouhungry</b> charges users an entry fee to
        attend Zomaland, where besides food, they can witness live musical performances and other acts. In 2018, it had
        organised the entertainment carnival in Delhi, Pune, and Bengaluru, where <b>areyouhungry</b> claimed over 100K people showed
        up. This year, Zomaland is going to Pune, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Jaipur, Pune, Chandigarh, and
        Kolkata</p>

    <h2>White Label Access</h2>
        <p><b>areyouhungry</b> also enables services such as <b>areyouhungry</b> Whitelabel under which they give offers to the restaurants to
        develop a customized food delivery app. It also works with cloud kitchens and restaurants for consultancy
        services. <b>areyouhungry</b> works with select restaurant operators to help in identifying locations for expansions at a
        minimal fixed cost, but with increased options for the user. It provides the requisite licenses and operational
        enablement for such restaurant partners.</p>



        <h2>Are You hungry Kitchen's</h2>
        <p>In order to be able to provide kitchen infrastructure services to select restaurant operators, <b>areyouhungry</b> works with
        entrepreneurs to set up and operate <b>areyouhungry</b> Kitchens under different labels. This helps entrepreneurs fund
        restaurants in the right location with an investment of INR 35 Lakh and more. <b>areyouhungry</b> claims it offers returns in
        the range of INR 2 Lakh to INR 4 Lakh per month to the investors, with 180+ affiliate kitchens already up and
        running.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>As it has grown in size and scale, <b>areyouhungry</b> has tried to reduce the reliance on cash-burn reliant models and
        streamlined to enter enablement and other user-generated streams of revenue. <b>areyouhungry</b> cash burn is mostly in
        retaining users against its rival Swiggy. However, being in the line of fire for deep discounting practices,
        <b>areyouhungry</b>s may soon be able to earn from other parts of its business model.</p>
